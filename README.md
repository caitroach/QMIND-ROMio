# ROMio - a markerless range of motion measurment system for physicians

In our 2026 QMIND Healthcare project, we used an Intel RealSense D435 camera with depth-sensing technology. It combines RGB cameras with infrared stereo depth sensors to produce a hybrid image of both colour and depth. These cameras are widely used in tasks involving facial recognition. 

We are using this camera in combination with MediaPipe's pretrained models to compute real-time angles of rotation in a subject's shoulders, exploring the feasibility of such a system in orthopedic ROM assessment. This is a work in progress!
